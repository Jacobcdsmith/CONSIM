 # Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (Hardened)

> Project: **EMERGENT-MCF-EI**
> Version: 2.0 with project-specific extensions (Reporting, SLAs, Appeals)

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

**Positive behavior includes:**

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Giving and receiving constructive feedback gracefully.
* Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them.
* Prioritizing the overall community’s best interests over individual preferences.

**Unacceptable behavior includes:**

* Sexualized language or imagery; sexual attention or advances of any kind.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments; personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment; doxxing or sharing private information.
* Other conduct reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Project-Specific Values & Norms

**Owner/Maintainer:** Jacob C. Smith (@Jacobcdsmith)
**Timezone for SLAs:** America/New\_York (ET)

We optimize for **intensity + respect**: pursue clear argument, curiosity, and rigor—never ad‑hominem. Poetry and sharp critique are welcome; **dehumanization is not**.

**Discourse norms (MCF context):**

* **Steelmanning first**: briefly restate the other person’s point before critique.
* **Cite evidence** for empirical claims; **mark speculation** as speculation.
* Keep artifacts **reproducible** (config files, seeds, versions, hardware notes).
* **No sexualized content** in community spaces. Keep language professional.
* Avoid **pseudo-authority**: differentiate lived intuition, theory, and data.

## AI/Generated Content Policy (Project-Specific)

* Label model outputs when they materially influence code/docs.
* Include **model name + version**, a brief **prompt/approach summary**, and any **safety caveats** if relevant.
* **No fabricated data or citations**. Provide sources or explicitly mark as hypothetical.
* You are responsible for anything posted from your account—even if model-generated.

## Research & Experimentation Safeguards

This repo explores consciousness-inspired simulations (EMERGENT‑MCF‑EI). Do **not** solicit or post instructions for unsafe experiments (e.g., high‑power EMF exposure, medical/therapeutic claims, or untested frequency protocols). Hardware discussions must include **safety limits and disclaimers**. **No medical advice.**

## Channels

Covered spaces include GitHub (issues, PRs, discussions, wiki), project chat (Discord/Matrix if enabled), real‑time calls, and conference representation of this project.

## Scope

This Code applies in all community spaces (GitHub issues/PRs, discussions, chat, events) and when an individual is officially representing the project.
**AI/Generated Content**: Content produced by tools, models, or bots that you post under your account is covered by this Code.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards and may remove, edit, or reject contributions (comments, commits, code, wikis, issues) not aligned with this Code. Reasons for moderation will be communicated when appropriate.

## Reporting

Report unacceptable behavior to **Jacob C. Smith** at **[Jacobcsmithd@gmail.com](mailto:Jacobcsmithd@gmail.com)**.
You may also use the **anonymous form** (see `REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`) or open a **confidential incident** issue via the provided template.

**SLAs (ET):** We will **acknowledge within 48 hours** and **begin review within 5 business days** (America/New\_York). If immediate safety is at risk, contact local authorities first.

### Contacts & Roles

* **Incident Lead (primary):** Jacob C. Smith — *[jacobcsmithd@gmail.com](mailto:jacobcsmithd@gmail.com)*
* **Deputy Maintainers:** *TBD; listed in `MAINTAINERS.md` once appointed*

## Privacy

We will respect the reporter’s privacy and security. Details will be shared strictly on a need-to-know basis.

## Enforcement Process (Summary)

See `ENFORCEMENT.md` for the full process. Outcomes include:

### 1. Correction

**Impact**: Inappropriate or unprofessional behavior.
**Consequence**: Private written warning with clarity about the violation; public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Impact**: Single incident or series of actions.
**Consequence**: Formal warning with conditions; restricted interactions for a specified period; violations may escalate to a ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Impact**: Serious violation; sustained inappropriate behavior.
**Consequence**: Time-bound ban from public/private interactions; violation during ban may lead to permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Impact**: Pattern of violations; harassment; aggression toward individuals or protected classes.
**Consequence**: Permanent removal from the community.

### Conflict of Interest

Any maintainer directly involved in an incident (or with a close personal/professional tie) must **recuse**. A deputy maintainer will be appointed for impartial review.

### Recordkeeping & Retention

Reports and decisions are kept privately with restricted access for **24 months**, unless legal/safety reasons require a different duration.
