## Ritual of Respect

We weaponize curiosity, not cruelty. Bigotry, harassment, or drive‑by toxicity gets insta‑vaporized. Read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and keep the space charged but safe.

## Bootstrapping Your Patch

1. **Fork + Clone** the repo.
2. **Branch** like you mean it: `feature/warp-drive`, `fix/time-paradox`, etc.
3. **Hack** with deliberate clarity—tiny commits, sharp messages.
4. **Verify**: run the test suite, smash edge‑cases, leave no orphan process alive.
5. **PR**: fire the flare when it’s stable.

## Bug Hunts

When the beast bites:

* **Search first**—someone may have tracked the creature already.
* Open an issue with **Steps, Expectation, Reality, Evidence** (logs/screenshots).

## Idea Catalysts

Got a cosmic upgrade? Sweet.

* Check for duplicates.
* Title it `Feature Request: [your spark]`.
* Pitch the benefit + rough roadmap.

## Pull‑Request Rite

* Keep your branch synced with `main`.
* Title = headline. Body = TL;DR + context.
* Link issues (`Closes #123`).
* Expect fire. Respond, refine, repeat.

## Code Alchemy

* Mirror existing style (`.editorconfig` is your grimoire).
* Self‑document—future devs are you in another timeline.
* Tests are non‑negotiable; unstable magic gets banished.

## Commit Spellcraft

* Present tense: "Fix event loop glitch."
* Minify fluff, maximize signal.
* Reference issues when relevant.

## Review Gauntlet

* **≥1 approval** required.
* Debate is welcome; ego‑fragility isn’t.
* Iterate fast.

## License & Lore

By contributing, you accept the project’s [LICENSE](LICENSE). Your code joins the multiverse—make it count.

**Build bravely. Ship weird. See you in the diffs.**
