 # Security Policy

This document explains how we maintain the security of the project and how you can help. Read it carefully before reporting vulnerabilities or relying on unsupported releases.

---

## Supported Versions

| Release Branch | Security Updates?     |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| **5.1.x**      | ✅ Actively maintained |
| **5.0.x**      | ❌ End‑of‑life         |
| **4.0.x**      | ✅ Long‑term support   |
| **< 4.0**      | ❌ No longer supported |

Only the branches marked with a green check receive security patches. Running unsupported code is at your own risk.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Contact us privately** – Email [JACOBCSMITHD@GMAIL.COM](mailto:JACOBCSMITHD@GMAIL.COM) with the subject line `Vulnerability Report: <concise summary>`.
2. **Encrypt your message** – Our PGP public key is located at `/SECURITY.pub`.
3. **Initial response** – We acknowledge reports within **48 hours**.
4. **Status updates** – You will receive progress reports at least every **7 days** until a fix or mitigation is released.
5. **Coordinated disclosure** – Please keep the details confidential for **90 days** or until a patch is published, whichever comes first.
6. **Recognition and rewards** – Accepted reports are listed in `HALL_OF_FAME.md`. Bounties are awarded based on severity and technical depth.

If a report is not accepted, we will explain the decision.

## Responsible Testing Guidelines

* **Proof‑of‑concept only** – Demonstrate the issue without harming data or systems.
* **No production impact** – Do not test against live infrastructure unless we explicitly approve it.
* **Avoid social engineering** – Focus on technical flaws, not people or physical facilities.
